When launching the application, the user is able to see parking spaces available for rent (all parking spaces with a rental start date after today's date). After registration and login, they can add parking spaces they want to list for rent on the home page. If a parking space is selected for rental, it is removed from the home page. The user who rented it can see the selected parking space in the "Active" tab, while in the "Archive" tab, there are parking spaces with past rental dates. Also, if a user rents parking, in the "Active" tab, they can see parking spaces they have listed for rental for future dates, while in the "Archive" tab, they can see parking spaces they have listed for rental with past dates. In the "Active" tab, the user can edit parking spaces they have listed for rental up to the day before the rental start date. The user renting the parking space can cancel the rental up to the day before the rental start date. The application is currently in development.
